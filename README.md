# The Watcher  
Hello! This is my super simple Python log analyzer/compiler/visualizer project for MAD2502.  
To run simply download all the files in a directory and to get started run:  
`
python3 main.py
`  
There is a default `logs` and `data` folders, but you can always specify where to store your logs and output .csv file using the flags `-l` and `-o`, respectively.
